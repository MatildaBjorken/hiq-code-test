### Questions

1. How much time did you end up spending on this coding test?
   I spent around 9 hours on this test. Around 2 hours to do research and build up a code structure. 4 hours for for the functionality with drag and drop and the counting of words.
   Lastly, around 3 hours for cleaning up code, adding the styling and testing.

2. Explain why you chose the code structure(s) you used in your solution.
   I chose to work with React with the usage of components and to keep the parts separated in that sense. Furthermore, the use of writing custom components and fast rendering in the DOM.
   I tried to work as much as possible in a top down way where I handled all the functionality in App and could send down the responses in the corresponding components. I tried to make my functions as mall as possible to make it easier for others to understand and make them easy to manage where I could test any potential bottlenecks.

3. What would you add to your solution if you had more time? This question is especially important if you did not spend much time on the coding test - use this as an opportunity to explain what your solution is missing.
   If I had more time I would have done tests to cover even more ground and make it look more lika a tool with more functionality, such as implementing local storage, make it possible to download the file and save the recent uploaded files in an archive. With that I would also structure the code more for scalability.

4. What did you think of this recruitment test?
   I have to admit that it was a bit challenging in the beginning to narrow it down but once I got started it was really fun! Nice with clear instructions but at the same time a lot of space for interpretation and creativity :-)
